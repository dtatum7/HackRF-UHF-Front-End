This project includes design and manufacturing files to produce a 400MHz to
500MHz UHF front end suitable for radio communications at distances of 5
miles or greater on a tuned omnidirectional antenna (as is used on a HAM
mobile rig, handy-talkie, or base station).

The project is in its infancy. HackRF UHF Front End is an evaluation and
prototyping platform to develop a half-duplex LNA and PA chain for the
HackRF at UHF frequencies covering HAM, commercial, GMRS, and other bands.
The design and layout files contain additional artwork to probe the RF
matching networks during testing. All power and control nets will be
externally controlled in the initial version. Futurerevisions will have
power supplies and control circuitry integrated onto the PCBA.

hardware notes:

Schematic, layout, and PCB manufacturing files were designed in KiCad, an open source electronic
design automation package. Simulations have been performed using LibreOffice
Spreadsheets and Qucs simulations as referenced in Documentation.
